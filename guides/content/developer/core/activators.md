## Overview

Activators are used to subscribe to specific events within a Spree Commerce storefront. Activators have the following attributes:

* `description`: Useful text to be displayed in a list of activators.
* `expires_at`: The time at which the activator is no longer active. Can be set to `nil` to indicate a never-ending activator.
* `starts_at`: The time at which the activator should begin being active. Can be set to `nil` to indicate the activator has always been active.
* `name`: The short name of the activator. Used with `description` to explain what the activator does.
* `event_name`: The event to subscribe to.

The subscription to these events is done with this code from inside the `spree` gem, which uses ActiveSupport's Notifications API:

```ruby
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe(/^spree\./) do |*args|
  event_name, start_time, end_time, id, payload = args
  Activator.active.event_name_starts_with(event_name).each do |activator|
    payload[:event_name] = event_name
    activator.activate(payload)
  end
end
```

This code from the engine class subscribes to all ActiveSupport notifications within the Rails application which begin with `spree.`. These events are typically caused by the use of `fire_event` within the `spree` app's controllers, like so:

```ruby
fire_event('spree.checkout.update')
```

This method itself calls `ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument` and passes through the arguments from this method. While it would seem that `fire_event` is just a shorter way of calling the method, it's also configured to pass through a default payload. This payload contains a `:user` key and an `:order` key, containing information about the current user (`try_spree_current_user`) and the current order (`current_order`) respectively.

The `fire_event` method can be used to pass additional payload information through, too:

```ruby
fire_event('spree.checkout.update', :extra => "information")
```

By calling `fire_event`, the notifications hook that is defined inside the engine is triggered. The next bit of the code finds all of the currently active `Activator` (and subclass) objects that match the event name. In the above example, all active `Activator` objects which are configured to use the `spree.checkout.update` event will be activated.

When each `Activator` object is activated, the `activate` method receives the payload from the `fire_event` method. Whatever the activator does with this is up to that specific activator.
